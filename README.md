# OpenXSAM XML Schema Definitions Repository

## Overview

This repository contains XML Schema Definition (XSD) files for OpenXSAM (Open eXtensible Security Assessment Methodology). OpenXSAM is an XML-based format designed primarily for sharing risk information in a machine-readable format. It enables security analysts to document and share essential information about assets, threats, risks, and cybersecurity controls. These definitions facilitate risk assessment and mitigation by providing a structured and standardized format for data exchange and analysis.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Sharing Risk Information

OpenXSAM allows security analysts to document and share information related to assets, threats, and risk information. It supports the exchange of data with various internal teams, external organizations, and automated threat intelligence sharing platforms, enhancing collaboration and threat mitigation.

### 2. Security Test Plan Authoring

Security test plan authoring benefits from OpenXSAM by providing valuable information on vehicle components, related functions, data flows, and associated cyber threat and risk information. This enables better-informed and more efficiently managed security testing processes.

### 3. Automated Attack Surface Management (ASM) and Detection and Response (D&R)

OpenXSAM's risk information model is instrumental in risk-informed detection correlation and attack prediction across various attack surfaces. It also contributes to reducing noise in security alerts and responses, enhancing the effectiveness of automated security measures.

### 4. Composition of Threat and Risk Assessments (TARA)

The repository supports the composition of individual Threat and Risk Assessments (TARAs) into comprehensive vehicle TARAs. This feature ensures that the assessment process is holistic, covering all relevant aspects of risk and security for a given system or asset.
